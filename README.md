At the start of each hand, the player has the opportunity to bet any amount of points that they have. Then, the dealer is dealt 2 cards with one turned over. The player is then dealt 2 cards face up and has the choice to hit or stand. If the player choses to hit, they will be delt another card. If the player choses to stand, the dealers card is turned over. If the player has a higher value than the dealer and less than 21, they win, otherwise the dealer wins.

# Blackjack

## Why Blackjack?
I decided to do Blackjack for my project because I really enjoy playing casino games. Blackjack is among my favorite casino games becuase there is no better feeling than being dealt a 21. 

## Rules
* Both the player and the dealer are dealt 2 cards.
* The player has 2 options, either hit or stand.
* If the player chooses to hit, they are dealt another card.
* However, if the player's score goes over 21, they bust.
* If the player chooses to stand, the dealer is dealt cards until they either have a higher score than the player, or go over 21.
* Once either the player or the dealer wins, the hand is over.
