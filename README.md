Blackjack is table game found in casinos where the point of the game is to beat the dealer without going over 21. I chose to create Blackjack because I like playing it with friends.

At the start of each hand, the player has the opportunity to bet any amount of points that they have. Then, the dealer is dealt 2 cards with one turned over. The player is then dealt 2 cards face up and has the choice to hit or stand. If the player choses to hit, they will be delt another card. If the player choses to stand, the dealers card is turned over. If the player has a higher value than the dealer and less than 21, they win, otherwise the dealer wins.
